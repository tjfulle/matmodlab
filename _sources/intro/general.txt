Overview of the Material Model Laboratory
=========================================

The Material Model Laboratory (Matmodlab) is a suite of tools designed for the development of material models intended for deployment in finite element codes.
Matmodlab includes:

* Matmodlab.Simulator, a specialized material model driver;
* Matmodlab.Permutator, a toolkit for determining model sensitivities to
  parameters;
* Matmodlab.Optimizer, an optimization toolkit for optimizing material model
  parameters;
* Matmodlab.Viewer, an interactive visualization tool.

The material model simulator can be thought to drive a single material point
of a finite element simulation through specific user designed paths. This
permits exercising material models in ways not possible in finite element
calculations, desgining verification and validation tests of the material
response, among others. Matmodlab is a small suite of tools at the developers
disposal to aid in the design and implementation of material models in larger
finite element host codes. It is also a useful tool for analysts for
understanding and parameterizing a material's response to deformation.

About Matmodlab
===============

Matmodlab is implemented in Python and leverages Python's object oriented
programming (OOP) design. OOP techniques are used throughout Matmodlab to
setup and manage simulation data. Computationally heavy portions of the code,
and many material models themselves, are written in Fortran for its speed and
ubiquity in scientific computing. Calling Fortran procedures from Python is
made possible by the `f2py
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/usage.html>`_ module, standard in
Numpy, that compiles and creates Python shared object libraries from Fortran
sources.

Using Matmodlab
===============

The Matmodlab.Simulator is run in batch mode from the command line (see
:ref:`model_create_and_execute`, for details). The main input the
Matmodlab.Simulator is a python script containing directives and data required
for the simulation. Directions on generating input scripts are provided in
this guide.

As you begin to use Matmodlab, it is recommended that you read and modify the many examples in the ``examples/`` directory in the root directory of Matmodlab.

Viewing the Results of a Matmodlab Simulation
=============================================

All simulation data is written to the output database. Output database files
can be visualized in Matmodlab.Viewer. See :ref:`viewer` for information on
using the visualization tools.
