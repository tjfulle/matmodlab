Overview
========

A matmodlab simulation consists of three parts: model definition, simulation,
and postprocessing.

**Model Definition**

Define a model as a python input script.

**Simulation**

Solve the numerical problem given in the model.  Output from the model is generated and stored in one of several output formats, ``dbx`` being the default.

**Postprocessing**

Model results can be evaluated in the Matmodlab viewer.  Additionally, model results can be evaluated using the output database scripting interface.
