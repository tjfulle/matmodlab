    "In contrast to elasticity, plasticity describes the deformation of bodies that undergo nonreversible changes of shape in response to applied load.  When a body transitions from elastic to plastic deformation it is said to \"yield\".  The yield transition point, also known as the **yield strength** is a property of the material and generally changes in response to continued loading.  When the yield strength increases with continued loading it is said to *harden* and the response is described by hardening theories of plasticity.  The simplified nonhardening theory of plasticity describes materials whose yield strength does not change in response to continued loading.  This notebook\n",
