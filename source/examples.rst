In this section, several example input scripts are described. A Matmodlab
input script consists of defining an instance of the
``MaterialPointSimulator`` class and defininig for it a ``material`` and
``steps``. The following examples provide illustration.

Simulations are run by processing Matmodlab input scripts with the ``mml``
command line utility::

  mml run filename.py

where ``filename.py`` is the name of the input script.
