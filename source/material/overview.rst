Materials: Introduction
#######################

Material constitutive models provide the material's complete mechanical response. In other words, given the current mechanical state and an increment in deformation, the material model returns

* the updated stress,
* the material stiffness, and
* the updated state dependent variable, if applicable.

Matmodlab Material Library

Matmodlab has a limited :ref:`library of material models <mat_builtin>`.

User Developed Materials
========================

Matmodlab provides an API for :ref:`user developed materials <user_mats>`.


Combining Material Responses
============================

Generally, constitutive models are treated as defining the entire mechanical
response of a material and cannot be combined with other models. However,
material models can be combined with the following behaviors:
