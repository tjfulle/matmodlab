Overview

An analysis in Matmodlab is defined by an input script, which

* is a Python script that imports the Matmodlab namespace; and
* defines a ``MaterialPointSimulator`` object.

Once defined, the input script is executed with the ``mml run`` procedure and results viewed with the ``mml view`` procedure.

The Input Script
================

Most input scripts have the same basic layout:

1) Import the Matmodlab namespace::

     from matmodlab import *

2) Instantiate the ``MaterialPointSimulator``::

     mps = MaterialPointSimulator('jobname')

3) Define the simulation steps. For example, a step of uniaxial strain::

     mps.StrainStep(components=(1, 0, 0))

4) Define the material model.  For example, a linear elastic material::

     mps.Material('elastic', {'K': 10, 'G': 8})

5) Run the job::

     mps.run()

Executing the Input Script
==========================

Once written, the input script is executed by the ``mml run`` procedure::

  $ mml run

Viewing the Results
===================

Once executed, the model results are viewed with ``mml view`` procedure::

  $ mml view
